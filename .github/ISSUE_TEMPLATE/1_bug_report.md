Hi,

# Checks before posting an issue

- [ ] I have read _all_ the documentation included in the extension itself as a walkthrough, including the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/vscode-angular-schematics/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) (from the VS Code menu: View > Command Palette >search "Documentation" > choose "Angular Schematics: Documentation and tutorial")
- [ ] I have checked in already:
  - [opened issues](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/vscode-angular-schematics/issues)
  - [closed issues](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/vscode-angular-schematics/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
  - [questions answered](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/vscode-angular-schematics/discussions/categories/q-a) in the new "Discussions" tab
- [ ] My project meets the requirements indicated in README
- [ ] My workspace is in [trusted mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust), not restricted mode
- [ ] I looked at the extension's logs ("Angular Schematics" Output channel, second tab left to the Terminal), and tried to fix my project's configuration accordingly
- [ ] I understand I am writing to a *human being*
- [ ] I will be involved in my own issue, by answering questions and informing if the issue is resolved

<!-- Otherwise the issue will be closed. -->
