Hi, thank you for using the Pro edition!

For one or more imports to be added in the standalone components imports picker of the Pro edition, please provide the following for each import:
- name<!-- of the module, component, directive or pipe-->:
- package:
- import path<!-- (which sometimes is not just the package name)-->:
- version<!-- of the package when this feature was added -->:

<!-- For example:
- name: MatButtonModule
- package: @angular/material
- import path: @angular/material/button
- version: >=5.0.0
-->
