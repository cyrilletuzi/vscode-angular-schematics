Hi,

# Checks before posting an issue

- [ ] I have read _all_ the extension's documentation:
  - [README](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/vscode-angular-schematics/blob/main/README.md)
  - [TROUBLESHOOTING](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/vscode-angular-schematics/blob/main/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- [ ] I have checked in already:
  - [opened issues](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/vscode-angular-schematics/issues)
  - [closed issues](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/vscode-angular-schematics/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
  - [questions answered](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/vscode-angular-schematics/discussions/categories/q-a) in the new "Discussions" tab
- [ ] My project meets the requirements indicated in README
- [ ] I understand this extension is just *using* Angular CLI schematics, it does *not* create files by itself, so any issue with the schematics should be reported in the relevant repository:
  - [Angular CLI issue tracker](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues)
- [ ] I launched `ng g component hello` in the *VS Code* Terminal inside my project, and it works
- [ ] I looked at the extension's logs ("Angular Schematics" Output channel, second tab left to the Terminal), and tried to fix my project's configuration accordingly
- [ ] I understand I am writing to a *human being*, doing this open source project *unpaid*
- [ ] I will be involved in my own issue, by answering questions and informing if the issue is resolved

<!-- Otherwise the issue will be closed. -->
