## NgModules

If your project uses Angular <=13 or is not ready for standalone components yet.

Once your Pro edition license is activated, force NgModules in the configuration helper.

<br>

## Class interceptors

If your project uses Angular <=14 or is not ready for functional interceptors yet.

Once your Pro edition license is activated, force class interceptors in the configuration helper.

<br>

## Class guards and resolvers

If your project uses Angular <=14.1 or is not ready for functional guards and resolvers yet. Note [class guards and resolvers are officially deprecated](https://angular.io/guide/deprecations#router-class-and-injection-token-guards) by Angular and planned for removal.

Once your Pro edition license is activated, force class guards and resolvers in the configuration helper.
