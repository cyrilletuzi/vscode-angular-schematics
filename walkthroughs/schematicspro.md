# Schematics Pro

<br>

The Angular Schematics extension for Visual Studio Code started as a tool to help my trainees during the Angular courses I teach. It is now **used by 600 000 developers**.

While still having a ton of automation ideas to increase productivity, good practices, optimization and architecture in Angular (and Ionic) projects, I have reached the limit of work I can do voluntarily (we are talking of *months* of full time *unpaid* work).

So instead of throwing in the bin all my ideas that could greatly enhance the every day developer experience of so many people, I decided to release new features in **[Schematics Pro](https://www.cyrilletuzi.com/schematics-pro/)**, which contains:
- more advanced features for Angular
- schematics for other frameworks too: React, Vue, Ionic, Svelte, Stencil, Lit and more
- easy and fast custom schematics creation
- architecture automation
