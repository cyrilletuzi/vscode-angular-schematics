# Angular Schematics - Documentation

This documentation is a copy of the integrated documentation included directly in Visual Studio Code, for alternative editors which do not support the VS Code "walkthrough" feature.

It should be used only in this case. Otherwise, the integrated documentation in VS Code is much better because it includes direct links to launch the adequate commands with just a click.

**You can access the integrated documentation at any time from the Angular logo on the left sidebar**,  or from the VS Code menu:
1. View
2. Command Palette
3. search "Documentation"
4. choose "Angular Schematics: Documentation and tutorial"
