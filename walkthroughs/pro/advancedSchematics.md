# Angular Schematics - Additional schematics ðŸ’Ž

Your Pro edition subscription includes the following additional schematics:
- page
- routes
- synchronous reactive service with signal
- asynchronous reactive service with RxJS
- Material (dialog, table)
- just ask for more!

## Page

How often did you forget to associate your page component to a route? It is the most missing schematic of the Angular CLI, and your Pro edition brings it to you.

The page schematic adds a special `Page` component type, with a `route` option to automatically add the route.

By default, for better application performances, pages are generated as lazy loaded components. But you can disable lazy loading in the configuration helper.

## Synchronous reactive service with signal

Angular 16 introduced signals to simplify reactivity management, but reactivity will always be a complex topic. So your Pro edition brings you a synchronous reactive service schematic with the new signal API, with documentation included.

## Asynchronous reactive service with RxJS

Signals are great but are synchronous, which does not fit to every situations. RxJS is still needed in some cases, and is more difficult to handle. So your Pro edition brings you an asynchronous reactive service schematic with RxJS with a normalized, simple and documented API to use.

## Just ask for more!
