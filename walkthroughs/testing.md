## Unit testing done right

By default, Angular CLI adds a spec file for each thing you generate. It is questionable for several reasons:
- in an application, e2e tests should be the focus and priority, not unit tests
- in front-end, trying to unit test everything is not relevant and is counter productive
- it pollutes the project with even more files than there already is

With the Pro edition, you can **generate spec files only when relevant**: just right-click your component / service / whatever, choose the "Unit test" schematic, and the according unit test will be added!

The current unit test schematic supports:
- Jasmine
- Jest
