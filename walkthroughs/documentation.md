# Angular Schematics - Documentation

This documentation is a copy of the integrated documentation included directly in Visual Studio Code, for alternative editors which do not support the VS Code "walkthrough" feature.

It should be used only in this case. Otherwise, the integrated documentation in VS Code is much better because it includes direct links to launch the adequate commands with just a click.

**You can access the integrated documentation at any time from the Angular logo on the left sidebar**,  or from the VS Code menu:
1. View
2. Command Palette
3. search "Documentation"
4. choose "Angular Schematics: Documentation and tutorial"

## Pro edition 💎

In this documentation and when using the extension, you will see some features marked with a diamond 💎. It means they are only available in the Pro edition.

While this extension is very popular, with 1 million installations, it is *not* a tool developed by the Angular team or affiliated to Google in any way.

It is months of *unpaid* work by a single contributor.

So feel free to enjoy advanced features and support a contributor at the same time! 💖

⚡️ To celebrate 1 million installations, the Pro edition is currently 50% off for a limited time.
