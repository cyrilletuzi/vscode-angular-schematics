# Keyboard shortcuts

You can bind keyboard shortcuts to the following actions:
- `ngschematics.generateComponent`
- `ngschematics.generateService`
- `ngschematics.generateModule`
- `ngschematics.generate`

But again, it's not the easiest way to use this extension:
**a right-click on a directory in the Explorer is better**
as the extension will infer the path where you want to generate the schematic.
